# Recorder-test
The objective is to create a replacement for Recorder 6 a MS SQL based database for wildlife management. Originally developed for use in the UK but now used in Europe as well.

The website for the current version can be found [here](http://www.recorder6.info).

## Steering Group
The Recorder 6 Steering Group has been created to instigate and oversee the development of a replacement for this interesting and important biological recording package. The users range from individuals to small/medium organisations.

## Feasability / Prototype
An initial prototype with the new web interface has been created and as of July 2022, a second prototype is being commissioned. This will complete a demonstration of the basic installation process required for testing and evaluation, also the completion of one of the interface dialogs. It is expected that this will allow a larger team to take that code and use it as the basis for completing the other dialogs required for the complete application.

Staying with MS SQL (T-SQL) as the backend for the database was done for simplification. Most of the code/functions should need little or no change and this with the data model will save much of the work. Effectively the client side of the database requires development.

The project is in need of Python programmers.
